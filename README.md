Module 20 HW Assignment

credit-risk-classification

## Background

* In this Challenge, you’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. You’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

* Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets

* Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data

* Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report

# Results
